# attachment-extractor-from-eml
This Python script recursively scans a specified directory for .eml files and extracts all attachments, saving them with unique, numbered filenames. It's ideal for bulk extraction of attachments from multiple .eml files. Simply specify the input and output directories and run the script with Python 3.
